# Nebula-Countdown

"Nebula Countdown" is a Wordpress plugin that lets you add countdowns to posts or pages on your website by inserting a shortcode specifying the date and time you wish to count down to.

## Settings Page

On the settings page in the Wordpress dashboard (found in the Settings menu), you have the option of specifying default values, as well as creating new countdowns with specific date and time. There's also instructions for the manual creation of shortcodes, as specified below.

## Manual Shortcode Creation

If for some reason you wish to create your countdown shortcodes manually instead of using the creation form, you can do so in the following way:

Insert a countdown into a post or page by using the `[count_flipclock]` shortcode. (You can do this as many times as you want).

You can customize the date and time of each countdown by adding the date/time info to the shortcode.

For example: `[count_flipclock year=2020 month=2 day=10]`.

Supported attributes are: year, month, day, minute and second!
